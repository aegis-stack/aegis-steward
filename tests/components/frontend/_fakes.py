"""Stand-ins for the Flet runtime, for tests that drive real components.

Flet controls are plain Python objects; the only genuinely runtime
pieces are the page (session) and pointer events. A test that builds a
panel and calls ``_render()`` needs neither rendered - just something
shaped like them.
