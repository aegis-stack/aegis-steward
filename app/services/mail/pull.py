"""Mail pulls itself: IMAP with an app password.

The Gmail API was ruled out for its OAuth client, consent screen and
seven-day tokens. IMAP needs none of that: a host, an address, a folder
(a Gmail label is one), and an app password - a secret in the encrypted
store like any other, verified by one sign-in at the paste. Every
provider speaks it.

Read-only, always: the folder is EXAMINEd, bodies are PEEKed, nothing
is flagged, moved or deleted. From now on, not from the beginning: the
first sight of a folder (or a renumbered one) only notes where it ends,
and each pull after asks for the UIDs above the last one seen (UIDs
climb within one UIDVALIDITY). History stays in the mailbox; reading
it on request is its own stream. Every message goes to the same ingest
a dropped ``.eml`` takes, so nothing downstream knows the difference.

The password reaches ``imaplib`` and nowhere else. What a failure says
is this module's own words: a server's text is never repeated.
